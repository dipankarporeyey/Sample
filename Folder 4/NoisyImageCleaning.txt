Image denoising using deep learning frameworks involves training a neural network to remove noise from noisy images. One common approach is to use 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for this task. Below, I'll describe a general framework for image denoising using deep learning:

**1. Dataset Preparation:**
   - Gather a dataset of noisy images along with their clean counterparts. You'll need pairs of noisy and noise-free images for supervised training.

**2. Data Preprocessing:**
   - Preprocess the images by resizing them to a common resolution, normalizing pixel values, and introducing the noise in the noisy images.
   - The noise can be added synthetically by applying various types and levels of noise (e.g., Gaussian, salt-and-pepper) to the clean images.

**3. Model Selection:**
   - Choose a suitable deep learning architecture for image denoising. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used due to their effectiveness 
     in handling spatial data like images.
   - You can design custom architectures or use pre-existing architectures like U-Net, ResNet, or variants specifically designed for denoising tasks.

**4. Network Architecture:**
   - Design the network architecture, typically consisting of an encoder-decoder structure.
   - The encoder extracts features from the noisy image, while the decoder reconstructs the denoised image.
   - Skip connections or residual connections can help preserve fine details.

**5. Loss Function:**
   - Define an appropriate loss function to measure the difference between the network's output (denoised image) and the ground truth clean image.
   - Common loss functions for image denoising include Mean Squared Error (MSE) and variants of it.

**6. Training:**
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Train the neural network using the training data. During training, the network learns to map noisy images to clean images.
   - Utilize techniques like gradient descent or its variants to optimize the network's parameters.
   - Monitor the model's performance on the validation set to prevent overfitting.

**7. Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Experiment with hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and network architecture to find the optimal configuration for your denoising task.

**8. Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the trained model on a separate test dataset to assess its performance. Common evaluation metrics include Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), 
     Structural Similarity Index (SSI), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
   - Visual inspection of denoised images can also provide insights into the model's performance.

**9. Post-processing (Optional):**
   - Depending on the results and specific requirements, you may apply additional post-processing techniques to further enhance the denoised images.

**10. Deployment:**
   - Once the model performs satisfactorily, you can deploy it to clean noisy images in real-world applications.

**11. Fine-tuning (Optional):**
   - If the denoising model doesn't perform well on certain types of noise or specific datasets, you may consider fine-tuning it on these data subsets to 
     improve its performance.

**12. Monitoring and Maintenance:**
   - Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain it as necessary to adapt to changing noise patterns or data distributions.

Deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras provide the tools and libraries needed to implement the above framework for image denoising. 
The choice of framework and specific implementation details will depend on your project's requirements and your familiarity with the chosen framework.
